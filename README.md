A weekend hackathon project inspired by Coinbase's Growth and Consumer org focus.

## Goal

 Help drive user growth by making it easier to discover and learn from trusted friends' portfolios

## What I Built

- Search and follow a friend
- See their top 3 assets --> later this can be customized to something else like favorited assets
- Interact via "Buy" or "Watchlist" buttons
- Session-based mock data, built in React + TypeScript + Tailwind
  - Using session storage for convenience of accessing onboarding experience

## Process

- Designed in Figma
- Developed and deployed to Vercel in under 48 hours
- Learned and used Coinbase design patterns for consistency (I tried my best to make it seamless)

## Future Ideas (If Extended)

- Profile customization (public/private)
- Send/Request crypto to/from friends
- Social feed of portfolio events (histories, anniversaries, posts, etc.)
- Coinbase API integration with GraphQL
- Responsive / accessibility (only desktop/tablet versions work ðŸ˜…)
