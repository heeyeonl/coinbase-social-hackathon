A weekend hackathon project inspired by Coinbase's Growth and Consumer org focus.

## Goal

Designed to support growth by making crypto feel more approachable — users can discover and follow trusted friends’ portfolios, making it easier to get started.

## What I Built

- Search and follow a friend
- View a friend's top 3 crypto assets
- Interact via "Buy" or "Watchlist" buttons
- Session-based mock data (no backend)
- Built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS

## Process

- Designed in Figma
- Developed and deployed to Vercel in under 48 hours
- Followed Coinbase’s design principles and patterns for consistency

## Future Ideas (If Extended)

- Profile customization, follower/following system
- Social feed of watchlist updates or milestones
- Backend integration using Coinbase API and GraphQL
